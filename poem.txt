Oh Dear! It took just a jiffy to publish
"The end" of our tale,
It took just a jiffy to shatter me down
in vain and render me your last present of pain,
It took just a jiffy to forget our infinite
promises and crumble our love's premises,
It took just a jiffy to terminate our
journey forever and feast the brutal passover,
It took just a jiffy to inculpate me for
misery and shut me inside sole mystery,
It took just a jiffy to leave me torn apart
and shove out my broken heart,
Yet, why does it take a gazillion hours
for me to let you go?
